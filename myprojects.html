                <h3>Nova Project</h3>
                <p>Let's start the presentation of my project with the name of my game : Nova Project. <br> Nova Project is a game that I realized myself, a kind of parody of the series of episode of the half life (that one does not present any more) because at the end of this one we can see "continuation of the story in episode 2", the episode 2 that I will never release like half life 2 episode 3 ;) <br> The interesting side of this project is that I realised it in unity in the c# language, I also made 1001 other project in unity in c# but I never finished them and they helped me to better master c# <br> You can visit the website <a href="https://nova-project-game.000webhostapp.com/Episode1.html" target="blank_">here</a></p>
